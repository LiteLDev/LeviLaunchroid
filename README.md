## Introduction

LeviLauncher is a lightweight, open-source Android launcher specifically designed for legitimate players of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition (MCBE). It provides a flexible and user-friendly alternative to the standard Google Play installation, allowing you to manage multiple game versions and extend functionality with external modules.

LeviLauncher enables you to import your official Minecraft APK and run it directly without requiring system installation. The launcher supports loading external native modules to enhance gameplay, provides robust multi-version management with complete isolation between installations, and includes built-in tools for managing resource packs and worlds. Whether you're looking to organize different game versions, test modifications, or optimize your gaming experience, LeviLauncher offers the flexibility you need.

5. Grant the necessary permissions when prompted during installation
6. Once installed, open LeviLauncher from your application drawer
7. Follow the in-app setup wizard to configure your game versions and settings

> **Important:** LeviLauncher requires a legitimate, licensed copy of Minecraft Bedrock Edition. Do not use this launcher with pirated or unauthorized versions of the game. Ensure your Minecraft license is valid and properly linked to your Microsoft account.
